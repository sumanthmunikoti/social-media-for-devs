# Social Media For Developers
#### Team member: Sumanth Munikoti

### Problem Statement:

I believe there is a need for developers to come together as a community on a social media platform, much like a combination of Twitter and StackOverFlow.  where they could leverage each other's knowledge for everyone’s benefit. A platform where users can post all their coding related questions like StackOverflow, and also express their thoughts like they would on a microblogging site like Twitter.

### Solution:

My project aims to connect developers through social media. It provides a platform where developers can update their public profile through which their experience credentials can be seen. Users can post their thoughts publicly to which other users can reply in comments, and express their feelings towards the post through “like” and “unlike” buttons. Also, it provides an option where a user can view other users’ profiles on a separate web page and connect with them.
